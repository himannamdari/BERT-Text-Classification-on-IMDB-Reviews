This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face Transformers to perform **binary sentiment classification** (positive or negative) on movie reviews from the IMDB dataset.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Uses `bert-base-uncased` from Hugging Face Transformers
- Binary classification of movie reviews (positive/negative)
- Simple Trainer API from Hugging Face
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy

## ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for full list.

## ðŸ§  Model

We use the BERT model for sequence classification:

We use a small sample from the Hugging Face IMDB dataset for quick training and evaluation
